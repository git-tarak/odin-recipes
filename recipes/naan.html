  <h3>Description</h3>
  <p>This is an authentic Indian Naan recipe. I have made this many times. It goes well with Indian curry which has a lot of gravy, such as the Butter Chicken.</p>
  <h3>Ingredients</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>2 cup of warm water</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon of active dry yeast</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon white sugar</li>
    <li>2 cup all purpose flour</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
    <li><sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub> cup of ghee</li>
    <li>2 tablespoon plain yogurt</li>
    <li>2 tablespoon kalonji(onion seed)</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Steps</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Whisk the warm water with the yeast and sugar until the yeast is dissolved. Cover and let stand in a warm place for 10 minutes.</li>
    <li>Sift flour and salt three times into a large bowl add the yeast mixture, half of the ghee and all the yogurt. Mix into a soft dough then knead on a floured surface for about 5 minutes or until dough is smooth and elastic. Place the dough in a large greased bowl, cover and let stand in a warm place for 1 1/2 hours or until the dough is doubled in size .</li>
    <li>Punch down dough then knead for 5 minutes. Divide dough into 6 pieces. Roll each piece out into 8 inch round naans.</li>
    <li>Cover an oven tray with foil and grease the foil. Brush the naan with a little of the remaining ghee and sprinkle with some of the kalonji. Cook naan one at a time under the broiler for about 2 minutes on each side or until puffed and just browned.</li>
